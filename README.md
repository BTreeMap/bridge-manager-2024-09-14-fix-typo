# Beeper Bridge Manager
A tool for running self-hosted bridges with the Beeper Matrix server.

The primary use case is running custom/3rd-party bridges with Beeper. You can
connect any standard Matrix application service to your Beeper account without
having to self-host a whole Matrix homeserver.

In the future, we may also support self-hosting the official bridges for
maximum security using this tool (so that message re-encryption happens on a
machine you control rather than on Beeper servers).

Please note that self-hosted bridges are not entitled to the usual level of
customer support on Beeper. If you need help with self-hosting bridges using
this tool, please join [#self-hosting:beeper.com] instead of asking in your
support room.
